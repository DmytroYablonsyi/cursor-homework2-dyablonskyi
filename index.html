        <article class="main"><p>A historical region in the west of Ukraine, lying north of the <b>Carpathians</b>, and bounded by the Zbruch River to the east. It borders with Poland. Galicia had its own medieval state, was a part of other European states, and also took an active part in the creation of the Ukrainian state. This is one of the active centers of the development of Ukrainian culture. The largest cities of the region are Lviv (whose historical center is part of the <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> heritage), Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil. The region has a rich castle heritage, entrepreneurship is developed here and social projects are implemented.</p></article>

            <h2>Iron age</h2>
            <p>At the end of the 5th century to n. e. Lusatian culture declines and is gradually replaced by the <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0">Laten culture</a> of the Celtic tribes who migrated from southern Switzerland to the east. Being the first in Europe to invent cavalry as a kind of army, the Celts easily conquered and assimilated the Lusatian tribes; in addition, Celtic iron weapons and ammunition were better than Lusatian. It was among the finds of the Latena culture in the Galician lands that the potter's wheel appeared for the first time. After all, from the middle of the VI century. arrived Slavic peoples settled on these lands - Carpathian Croats[13] (according to other sources, white and red Croats[14]), Dulibs, Tiverts, Buzhans, etc. The local Celtic and Celtic-Lusatian tribes were partly displaced to Western Europe, partly assimilated. However, many toponyms and cultural and everyday elements of Celtic folklore remained in the culture of Slavic tribes (<a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B2%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0">Boikivshchyna</a>)

            <h2>Late middle age</h2>
            <p>In the middle of the 14th century, Galicia became the object of a dispute between the Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Hungary and the State of Lithuania. On April 7, 1340, in Volodymyr, the last Galician-Volyn prince, Yuriy II Troydenovich, was poisoned by the Galician[source?] boyars. The Polish (<a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_III_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9">Cazimir III</a>) and Hungarian (Ludovic I, who recognized the traditional royal rights to Galicia[19]) took advantage of this, and hurried to send troops to Galicia. Casimir III captured several castles in a surprise attack and took the booty. In response, the ruler of the Kingdom of Rus, Dmytro Dedko, appealed to the Tatars for help, so the Poles (with considerable booty) were forced to turn back. Soon Dmytro Dedko and Casimir III concluded a peace agreement. At that time, the process of consolidation of the peasantry continued in Galicia, which ended in 1505. This caused dissatisfaction among the peasants and was manifested in a number of uprisings, the largest of which took place in 1490â€“1492 under the leadership of Mukha and Borula. In the first half of the 16th century, the Opryshki movement developed in Podkarpattia, which reached its peak in the 18th century under the leadership of <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%88">Oleksa Dovbush.</a></p>
